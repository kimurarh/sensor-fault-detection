# Sensor Fault Detection

Sensors have been widely used especially in industrial and agricultural sectors. Recently, the application of IoT systems to automate business's tasks have increased even more the usage of sensores, creating a huge amount of data (big data).

Dealing with these industrial systems has become increasingly complex and it is difficult to obtain an analytical model of the system. In this context, the use of Machine Learning algorithms can be of great help in understanding and detecting failures. 

## Objective

The goal of this project is to explore Machine Learning techniques to detect failures in a time series.
